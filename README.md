# Customer-Purchase-Prediction
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that determines whether a customer is likely to make a purchase based on various behavioral and demographic features. Using a dataset that includes attributes such as Age, Gender, Annual Income, Number of Purchases, Product Category, Time Spent on Website, Loyalty Program Membership, and Discounts Availed, multiple machine learning algorithms were evaluated for their predictive performance.

The following models were tested:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Random Forest Classifier

Among them, the Random Forest Classifier demonstrated the best performance, achieving an accuracy of 94%, indicating strong predictive power and generalization to unseen data.
